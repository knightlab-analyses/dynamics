# Sample Collection Time is Critical for Microbiome Result Reproducibility

Although many aspects of microbiome studies have been standardized to improve experimental reproducibility, none account for how the daily circadian fluctuations in the gut lumen affect dynamic changes in 16S sequencing and untargeted LC-MS/MS metabolomic results. Here we show that sample collection time affects the conclusions drawn from metabolic microbiome studies, especially in relation to a daily study exposure. The divergence of the microbiome composition between an experimental and control group due to a daily exposure was unique to each specific experiment. Sample collection times that are only four hours apart could lead to vastly different conclusions. These dynamic changes are pronounced in the 16S sequencing results, but not detectable with the metabolome. Thus, the lack of consistency in the time of sample collection could explain poor cross-study reproducibility in microbiome research.
