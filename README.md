# Microbiome Diurnal Dynamics Dominate Phenotype Effects, Enabling Replicability When Controlled

Although many aspects of microbiome studies have been standardized to improve experimental replicability, none account for how the daily diurnal fluctuations in the gut lumen cause dynamic changes in 16S sequencing and untargeted LC-MS/MS metabolomic results. Here we show that sample collection time affects the conclusions drawn from microbiome studies and are larger than the effect size of a daily experimental intervention or dietary changes. The divergence of the microbiome composition between an experimental and control group due to daily exposure is unique to each specific experiment. Sample collection times as short as only four hours apart lead to vastly different conclusions. These dynamic changes are pronounced in the 16S sequencing results. Thus, the lack of consistency in the time of sample collection explains poor cross-study replicability in microbiome research and leads to an incorrect understanding of the role of the gut microbiome in physiological homeostasis and pathophysiological studies.

Basically, if we are not controlling for host circadian rhythm time, it is like trying to measure sea level rise while not knowing that tides or waves exist.
